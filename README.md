# Hello, Test Containers 

This repository is a demonstration of test containers using dotnet. 
Follow along with test containers at 
[the dotnet getting started page](https://testcontainers.com/guides/getting-started-with-testcontainers-for-dotnet/).

Testcontainers is a testing library that provides easy and lightweight APIs for bootstrapping integration tests with real services wrapped in Docker containers. Using Testcontainers, you can write tests that talk to the same type of services you use in production, without mocks or in-memory services.
